Market Stress Indicators
	
	I don't know how much we should focus on technical analysis theory (or lack thereof)
	
	technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression
	Random Walk Indicator - a technical indicator that attempts to determine if a stock’s price movement is random in nature or a result of a statistically significant trend
	
Visualizations
	It's pretty much all based on visual pattern recognition, so the charts we pick are kinda important
	Scientific approach is based on velocity and acceleration and Froude number
		
		
Measuring Financial Market Stress - Kliesen, Smith
		
		St. Louis Fed’s Financial Stress Index (STLFSI) is constructed using principal components analysis (PCA), which is similar to the construction of the Kansas City Fed’s FSI (KCFSI).
		
		
		default risk - difference between yields on a risky asset and a risk-free asset
		liquidity risk - inability to secure funding to finance short-term liabilities
		The STLFSI and the KCFSI can be thought of as coincident indexes rather than as leading indexes—that is, they are designed to measure developments as they occur. However, they have leading indicator properties because rising levels of financial stress, as recently seen, can portend economic turmoil and disruption.
		the STLFSI seemed to accurately capture the subsequent turmoil and financial stress - macro history look back indicator
		
		Appendix - it's pretty much Fama-Macbeth two part regression
		
			Data is weekly frequency over a sixteen year window
			
			variables are standardized
			Principal Component Analysis is used to calculate the coefficients of the variables in th index
			Scale coefficients so SD of index is 1
			the observation of the FSI for time t is the sum of each series multiplied by its respective adjusted coefficient
			
			
			FSI output is the percent of the total variation in the 18 variables over the sample period that is explained by the index
				FSI is 1 - (Total Sum of Squares / Sum of Square Errors)
				
			note: I don't think they're adjusting for heteroscedasticity. Maybe use Newey-West estimator

	Key Features of Financial Stress
		Increased uncertainty about fundamental value of assets 
			Manifestation: 
				greater volatility in the market prices of assets
			Knightian uncertainty
			
		Increased uncertainty about behavior of other investors
			Manifestation: 
				greater volatility in the market prices of assets
			
		Increased asymmetry of information - increased asymmetry of information between lenders and borrowers or buyers and sellers of financial assets
			Manifestation:
				the variation in the true quality of borrowers or financial assets might increase
				lenders losing confidence in the accuracy of their information about borrowers
		
		Decreased willingness to hold risky assets (flight to quality)
			Manifestation:
				widening spread between the rates of return on the two types of assets and increase the cost of borrowing for relatively risky borrowers
				appetite for risk falls
				
		Decreased willingness to hold illiquid assets (flight to liquidity) - final sign of financial stress is sharp decline in willingness to hold illiquid assets
			A flight to liquidity can occur for two reasons:
				increase in the demand for liquidity to protect against unexpected cash needs
				decrease in the perceived liquidity of some assets
			
			Need for liquidity - increased volatility in asset prices triggers margins and 
			Reduced Perceived liquidity - Market values of some assets falling below their fundamental, hold-to-maturity values. Investors will view such assets as illiquid because they cannot be sold to raise cash without taking a substantial loss
		
			Manifestation:
				Secondary Market for Asset is thin - selling a substantial amount of the asset has large affect on the price
				widening spread between the rates of return on the two types of assets and increase the cost of borrowing for those firms that issue illiquid securities
	
	
	Conclusion:
		It's ok as a leasding indicator, I don't know how well it will work on a smaller time interval. Might want to use IMF for cross country comparisons, but that's really slow too. The IMF one also is kinda new, but they give a lot of info on it as well as just the general construction of Financial Stress Indicators.
