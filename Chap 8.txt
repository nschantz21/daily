Chap 8: Modeling Volatility and correlation

Tests for non-linearity
	Able to detect a variety of non-linear structures in data, although these tests are unlikely to tell the researcher which type of non-linearity is present.

	RESET test
	BDS test

Most applications of the above tests conclude that there is non-linear dependence in financial asset returns series, but that the dependence is best characterised by a GARCH-type process.
Specific tests are unlikely to detect other forms of non-linearities in the data, but their results will by definition offer a class of models that should be relevant for the data at hand.
