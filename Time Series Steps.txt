Time Series Steps

Univariate:
	Auto-regression - Test for Stationarity
		Get correlation coefficients with Autocorrelation Function (acf) or correlogram.
		Conduct Significance Tests for the autocorrelation coefficients by constructing a non-rejection region for an estimated autocorrelation coefficient to determine whether it is significantly different from zero.
		Test joint hypothesis that all correlation coefficients are simultaneously equal to zero with the Ljung-Box statistic.
		Remember: the effect of the significant autocorrelation coefficient is diluted in the joint test by the insignificant coefficients.
	Moving Average - testing for Heteroscedasticity
	
	
	Partial Autocorrelation Function (pacf)
		Measure the effects of a lagged variable, while controlling for the effects of the intermediating time steps.
	
	ARMA
		Identification
			Plot the data over time, the acf and the pacf to determine the order of the model required to capture the dynamic features of the data.
		Estimation
			Maximum Likelihood estimation of parameters of the model in the Identification step.
		Diagnostic Testing
